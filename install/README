INSTALLATION
============

To install uzERP, log in as the root user, or log in and switch to the root
user, go to your Apache root directory which is usually located
at /var/www. Create a directory under this location with whatever name you
want to identify this uzERP installation; we recommend you name it something
like uzerp or uzerp-live.

Copy this archive to the the uzerp directory you created and unpack it, then
go to the install directory in the uzerp directory and run the install script.
The install script will check your system configuration and prompt for various
pieces of information required by the install. At then end of the install, you
should have a fully functioning system, with a basic starter database.

Installation example:-

log in as root user or su - root
cd /var/www
su -l www-data mkdir uzerp-live
cd uzerp-live
su -l www-data cp <location of archive file> .
su -l www-data tar -zxf uzerp-base.tar.gz
cd install
./install

A log of the install wil be written to the install directory.

We recommend that you also create a test instance of uzERP for training
and testing purposes. Repeat the above installation but create the uzerp
directory under /var/www with a name such as uzerp-test.


UPDATES
=======

There are scripts in the install directory that help manage updates.
We recommend you create a release directory under the apache root directory
named, for example, releases. In this directory create a sub-directory with
the same name as your uzerp directory above. Copy the sample release_config
file from the install directory to the uzerp release directory and edit it
to specify the correct uzerp names for your installation.

There are two main scripts:-

download_release will download the specified release archive from a remote
                 server

installRelease will install all files in date order in the download directory

To check the paramaters for any of the scripts, run the script with -? or -h
as the only parameter:-

e.g. installRelease -?

This will output:-

----------------------------------------------------------------------
installRelease

Requires up to 3 parameters:-
  - release base directory (optional, default will look in /)
  - target install directory (optional if specified in release_config file)
  - database (optional if specified in release_config file, defaults to target name)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You may find it easier to run these scripts if you move them a location that
is defined in the $PATH variable, such as /usr/local/bin.
